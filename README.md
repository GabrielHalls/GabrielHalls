## Hello, my name is Gabriel.

üî≠ I am seeking a Junior position. I am 29 years old and have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from Faculdade Flamingo. Currently, I am learning back-end development with Node.js and MySQL.

Check out my experiences: I have experience with Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React), including college projects and personal projects.

I participated in the StartFuture bootcamp from 07/01/2023 to 10/01/2023, working in two squads over three months with the goal of developing an HR web system called Onboarding-me.

I also completed a 60-hour Python extension course recognized by Faculdade Flamingo.
